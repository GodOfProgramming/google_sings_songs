Something has stuck in, underneath my skin
Eyes all looking in for something within
Somewhere in here
Now everything I say gives this all away
Senses deadened again, nothing lives today
Not in here, here in your head

Careful what you're feeling on the inside
You should try to remember
The good times and the high life
Are you feeling alright?

Felt that I belonged and now I feel that gone
Where it all went wrong, I traced it all along
Back here again
There was something calling me to negativity
Dark covering me, shrouding every scene
I'm cast in

Careful what you're feeling on the inside
You should try to remember
The good times and the high life
Are you feeling alright?

Careful when you're feeling out of your mind
You should try to remember
The strong lines in the spotlight
Till you're feeling alright

Please answer, I'm calling just to find out
If you could be here for me when I crack
The answer came, I found it buried in the trash there
I saw it stare, I saw it stare, I saw it stare, I saw it stare

Careful what you're feeling on the inside
You should try to remember
The good times and the high life
Are you feeling alright?

Careful when you're feeling out of your mind
You should try to remember
The strong lines in the spotlight
Till you're feeling alright

Careful what you're feeling on the inside
You should try to remember
The good times and the high life
Are you feeling alright?
