I will not last for you.
I have clothes like cage, but I can't control.
With me hate animals
I'm angry I didn't keep it
The wall, in your closet, wood into the room
Can't stand and control
My heart is hid me
Why is no one to be saved? Border

I think it's deeply under the skin
I have to agree that I feel like Cuba
I hate other dreams
I have to agree that I feel like Cuba
I'm doing myself well
I'm doing myself well

Precise
I have clothes like cage, but I can't control.
Because I want to get out of it, so it would hurt me
Why is no one to be saved? After all!

I think it's deeply under the skin
I have to admit that I feel a hundred years
I hate other dreams
I have to admit that I feel a hundred years
I think it's deeply under the skin
I have to admit that I feel a hundred years
I'm doing myself well

Put the secret teeth in the dark when smart and smart and mental
I can't escape my soul to be my heart
No one can call me, dreams
Or way, this great stop

I think it's deeply under the skin
I have to admit that I feel a hundred years
I hate other dreams
I have to admit that I feel a hundred years
I think it's deeply under the skin
I have to admit that I feel a hundred years
I miss your power
I have to admit that I feel a hundred years
I'm doing myself well
I'm doing myself well
I'm doing myself well
I'm doing myself well
