I don't look like you as I go to
Because it's free (I'm published)
Feelings can leave in time in time
But it's a lot

What are you talking about?
I tell you what I am and what I am
Wild! (Hello!)

Try to enter. Try to clean my energy
I will tell you what I do
It's easy to try to cut from me
I will tell you what I do

Easy!

Hundred million, I also know
Everybody, when all falls, when you return to numbers (when entering)
Because I can't get more
All black marks return

You see (you say)?
What happened to me too
In this archive! (Hey! Yes!)

Try to enter. Try to clean my energy
I will tell you what I do
It's easy to try to cut from me
I will tell you what I do

Easy!

You can try another life
You can try more
(Hello!)

(Okay!)

Try to enter. Try to clean my energy
I will tell you what I do
It's easy to try to cut from me
I will tell you what I do

Easy! (Okay!)

Try to go with me (I'll show you what you do)
Try to clean my energy (tell me what I do)
I will show you
What do I do
