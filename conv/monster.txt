I can not find my page
Be quiet, but do not stress
Stay away from me and support the animals
I was frustrated and impatient
Graffiti on walls, beds, clothes
Come see the untamed trail
Under the bed, on the body, on the head
Why did they fail to save me? Read more about it

I think it goes deeper
I'm like a ghost
I do not want to be honest
I'm like a ghost
I love pets
I love pets

Your password is locked and locked
Be quiet, but do not stress
"If you send me, believe me, and you trust me."
Will he save me? Stop!

I think it goes deeper
I'm like a ghost
I do not want to be honest
I'm like a ghost
I think it goes deeper
I'm like a ghost
I love pets

He gritted his teeth in the dark
There is no salvation, no spiritual desires, no desires
No one cried, maybe a dream
Or I love my pets

I think it goes deeper
I'm like a ghost
I do not want to be honest
I'm like a ghost
I think it goes deeper
I'm like a ghost
The loss of control is enormous
I'm like a ghost
I love pets
I love pets
I love pets
I love pets
