No skill worked
He will not kill the poor like a thief.
I am tired of living like a blind man
I am tired of this nonsense
So remember me

I'm the one who remembers me
I'm the one who remembers me

I don’t want to forgive
The background story
I'm lying now
I will be proud
It was a mistake
At the bottom of each bottle
Five words in my head
- Something? who is crying

it’s not really
it’s not really

I don't have any
I said "I love you" and swore
It must be a sin
The purpose of life is to kill you and me.

I'm the one who remembers me
I'm the one who remembers me

I don’t want to forgive
The background story
I'm lying now
I will be proud
It was a mistake
At the bottom of each bottle
Five words in my head
- Something? who is crying

it’s not really
it’s not really
it’s not really
it’s not really

No skill worked

So remember me
So remember me

I'm the one who remembers me
I'm the one who remembers me

I don’t want to forgive
The background story
I'm lying now
I will be proud
It was a mistake
At the bottom of each bottle
Five words in my head
- Something? who is crying

are we having fun
are we having fun
Yes he (five sounds in my head).
are we having fun
Yes, yes (these five words in my mind).
Not at all
