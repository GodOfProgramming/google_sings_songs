You heard?
One and only

Oh, beef
Oh, beef
H! H!
H!

Drown the sea
Damage to your kids what I do
(Give me?)
Seemed a symbol of a sanctate human man
Change carefully
(Give me?)

Depending on what I want in myself
Suddenly converts violence.
Oh not, now I haven't been there.
You wake up like crazy in me.

Vertical and disease
Vertical and disease
Vertical and disease
To open your hate and tide me.
Vertical and disease
You are a round mother of this disease.
You want, let's hurt this.
This is a gift that makes me free

You see a good disease.
Don't try to hate yourself.
(Give me?)
Seem to die
And I'm going
(Give me?)

Do you have any problems
Traveled this changes in war and this change
Oh, that's not the world.
Now you wake me madness in me.

Vertical and disease
Vertical and disease
Vertical and disease
To open your hate and tide me.
Vertical and disease
You are a round mother of this disease.
You want, let's hurt this.
This is a gift that makes me free

And if I dreamed ...
And if I dreamed ...
And if I dreamed ...
And if I dreamed!

No, Mom, don't do this again!
Don't do this again, and I will be a good child!
I will be a good child, I promise!
No, my mother, don't kill me!
Do you kill me like a moon?
Don't do this, my hurts!
Will you win?
Do you do? Do you want you to die?
Do you want you to die?
Why don't you go here?
Don't strike my hand again!
Grow! I don't like this nonsense!
Do you have a guy, sad, weird?
My water, how do you want to hear and mama?
Don't be dead here!

Oh, beef

Vertical and disease
Vertical and disease
Vertical and disease
To open your hate and tide me.
Vertical and disease
You are a round mother with this disease.
You want, let's hurt this.
Now madness
