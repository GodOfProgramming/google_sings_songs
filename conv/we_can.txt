This is Hera! Bless you!

There are!

Sonic the Hedgehog
We cannot stop this adventure until we save the world
He is no longer alone; we have friends
As a company, we can only take action

Together we can overcome all obstacles
Meditation has never been so difficult
Only everyone can do something special
The secret is to share your dreams

(to be seen!)

If we are united, we can
we will never give up
everything went smoothly

All good things belong to them
Together they are stronger than ever

Better a poor horse than no horse at all.

Sonic fast down
We will stay by the lake to rest
Most of my head rests on my arms and I travel comfortably
Save the world and learn Eggmen!

Together we can overcome all obstacles
Meditation has never been so difficult
Only everyone can do something special
Share your secret dreams (oh, ho!)

(to be seen!)

If we are united, we can
we will never be separated
Much easier with my friends

All good things belong to them
Together they are stronger than ever

He's better than you!
He's better than you!

you can overcome all obstacles
Hard to imagine (yes, yes!)

If we are united, we can succeed
we will never give up
everything went smoothly

Everything is mutually beneficial
Together they are stronger than ever

We can't stand it because it's just as powerful!

(There are!)
